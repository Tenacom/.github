## Reporting a Bug

We at Tenacom take all security bugs in our projects seriously.
Thank you for improving the security of our projects.
We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure
and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Report security bugs by emailing us at [security@tenacom.it](mailto:security@tenacom.it?subject=Vulnerability%20report)

We will acknowledge your email, typically within 48 hours, and will send a more detailed response within 48 hours
indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, we will endeavor
to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement,
and may ask for additional information or guidance.

## Disclosure Policy

Upon receiving a security bug report for one of our projects, we will assign it to a primary handler.
This person will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

* Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
* Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
* Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance.
  These fixes will be released as fast as possible through the appropriate channels (e.g. NuGet).

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved, please submit a pull request
on our [Community health](https://github.com/Tenacom/.github) project.
