Tenacom is a very small :house: software house with very big :bulb: ideas, founded in 2015 by Riccardo De Agostini a.k.a. [@rdeago](https://github.com/rdeago). We are located :earth_africa: in North-Eastern Italy.

Our main source of revenue :moneybag: is **smart interfaces** (think microservices, but nicely packaged :canned_food: as tiny embedded computers) that add networking and automation capabilities to traditional, serial-port-equipped field devices. :sauropod:**Â»**:rocket:

You will hardly find out about us on the Web :spider_web:; in fact, we don't even have a site. Our reputation is built exclusively on word of mouth :loudspeaker: between customers and prospects.
